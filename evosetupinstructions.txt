I used windows for this and I recommend using just a basic virtual environment, if you use docker it'll do docker in docker which is difficult to setup


So this is how to set up my evo.ninja,

git clone https://github.com/AhmadNoblis/BioSurveillanceEvo

Install docker desktop in background and keep running in the background as the project uses it 

nvm install && nvm use
yarn && yarn build
npm install express
npm install cors
npm install concurrently
cd apps/browser
yarn db:start  
in apps/browser copy my .env I sent you

yarn dev           in localhost:3000 this should have the app


I'm not sure if yarn db:start will override my frontend changes or not, if it does I can go through and remove stuff from .gitignore.
